⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES

v3.0.0 does not support to upgrade from the previous version due to
- Design change
  - Using AWS Step Functions instead of AWS Fargate to run a simulator
  - Merged `devices` and `widgets` into `simulations`
  - Merged `device-widgets`, `sim-settings`, and `sim-metrics` Amazon DynamoDB tables into `Simulator` DynamoDB table

- UI framework migration: Angular JS to React
- Change `helper` AWS Lambda function to TypeScript
- Abstracted devices - devices are no longer created and stored, they will be generated in the simulator lambda using the specified device type and amount specified for each device type
- Simplified `boolean` attribute: no `max` and `min` to generate `boolean` data
- Automotive demo attributes aggregated into a single message
